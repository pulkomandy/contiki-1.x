contiki-1.x
===========

The historical Contiki 1.x sources

This fork is an attempt to get the CPC version of Contiki 1.x running again.
The port never left the proof of concept stage and could use some love.

The build has been fixed to work with a current SDCC (3.4) but currently the OS
(contiki.bin) will crash right after loading. Some debugging will be needed.
